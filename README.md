A remake of the 2013 mobile game Flappy Bird
Flappy Bird Remake
-------------------

This repository contains a remake of the popular Flappy Bird game, implemented in Lua using the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) framework. The game faithfully recreates the addictive and challenging gameplay of the original Flappy Bird, where players control a bird and navigate through gaps in the pipes to achieve the highest score possible.

Features:
- Simple and intuitive controls
- Randomly generated pipe obstacles
- Score tracking and display
- Game over detection and restart functionality
- Sound effects and background music

The project serves as a fun and educational exercise in game development, demonstrating the use of Lua and LÖVE to create a fully playable game. Whether you're a fan of the original Flappy Bird or interested in game development, feel free to check out the code and try the game for yourself.

Note: This project is for educational purposes only and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the original Flappy Bird game or its creator.
